# Overview
This is nothing more than a traditional hello world program. It's written in C++ and, once compiled and run, will print the phrase "Hello World!" on the terminal screen.

### Program manual
This C++ program doesn't ask for any input from the user. It will simply output the phrase "Hello World!" on the terminal screen then it will stop. If we run the code on VS Code, we can see the result clearly, but we won't have enough time to observe the result when we run the built .exe. A black screen will flash briefly, too brief, and that's it.

### Code structure
There's just a single line of code in the main function. The ```#include <iostream>``` is the command to import a C++ standard library that is necessary for input-output operations. The library is only restricted to the C++ language, though, not for both C and C++.
