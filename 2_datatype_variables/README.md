# Overview
This set of C++ codes are just to demonstrate how we can declare and assign values to different types of variables. A constant is also defined. All values are shown in the terminal with the ```cout``` command.

### Program manual
This program does nothing more than displaying the values of the different types of variables. The mentioned variable types are ```int```, ```float```, ```double```, ```bool```, ```char```. The code also demonstrates the use of ```const```. These values gets assigned and then gets printed out by the ```cout``` command.

### Code structure
The code of this very simple program is written in one block in the ```main``` function in the ```main.cpp``` file. 


### Program flow
1. A variable gets declared and its value assigned
2. The variable's value gets printed out by the ```cout``` command
3. The steps repeat from 1. for the different types of variables mentioned above
