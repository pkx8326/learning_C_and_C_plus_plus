# C/C++ Learning

### About this repository
I'm documenting my C/C++ learning journey in this repository. It is made public so that it may also be of help to those learning the language just like myself.

### Learning materials
I'm learning the language from various online sources. Since I'm using a Windows machine and Visual Studio Code as an IDE, I setup my developing environment following the instructions in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMWD7wfhgNY). Refer to the [learning resources](https://github.com/pkx8326/learning_C_and_C_plus_plus/tree/main/0_learning_resources) folder for more learning materials. 

The day I'm writing this is October 24, 2024 and that video is already 1 year old, but the information is still up-to-date and very helpful. I'll create an increasingly long list of learning material in a separate text file in this repository. 

### Repository structure
Each C/C++ project, no matter how small it is, has its own folder and its own README.md file in its respective folder. This is my way of journaling my learning, and it should also be benificial to whoever learning the language comming across this repository.

### What to do next?
If possible, let's enjoy the learning journey together. Peace!
